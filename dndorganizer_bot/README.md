# Bot for DnD character sheet organization in phone

Have you ever forgotten your character sheet? Or that you wanted to add something, but there is no more space on the sheet? That's why I decided to make a Telegram bot that would store all the information from the character's letter in your phone!


## Details

This project was started as impulsively as possible - I was tired of carrying my character sheets with me, and I had no desire to go to the ones specialized for this site. It was then that the decision was made to steam a little, but to make my own bot.
For work, since this was my first bot, the **"telebot"** library was chosen. However, I already understand that it was a wrong decision, but if I started and already wrote so much, then it is too late to stop.


## Features in newest ver.

- character creation (race, class, pronouns)
- adding characteristics
- inventory display
- reputation system
- system of experience with DnD
- a short rest
- a long rest
- rest between parties


## Lessons Learned

What did I learn while working on this project? First, I improved my skills in working with Python. If you don't take it so generally - I got acquainted with the libraries for working with Telegram functions and was able to make a very good working bot) which after the end of the development I will send it to my server and it will be available 24/7 to everyone!
