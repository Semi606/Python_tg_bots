# Python bots for Telegram

Once, one warm summer day, life was too easy for me, and in addition to work tasks, I set myself another one - to improve my python by writing bots for the popular messenger in Ukraine - Telegram.


## Details

In this repository, you will find all the bots I created for Telegram and, accordingly, all the necessary files for them. I, like all people, learn from my mistakes and want to improve, so here I will observe how things progress.
